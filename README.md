# QueueTube
<p>A Google Chrome extension which serves to improve users' experiences on YouTube by providing a means to queue up various videos they are interested, all at once</p>

Sadly, I'm done working with this project seeing as YouTube has now incorpated queueing capabilities into their site. So I'll be removing the extension as well. ~
